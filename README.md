# operators are : ~, &, v, >, <>, (3x) [existential], (4x) [universal quantifier]. You can also input the unicode characters for the quantifiers. Note that you cannot use "v" as a variable or name because it's used for the disjunction.

# Started to add the ability to use astericks after variables or objects to increase number of variable and object names, but haven't finished yet.
